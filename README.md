# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	If I were to Kickstart a play, I would want know what makes some plays succeed and others fail.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	June has the highest rate of success at 70%.  December has the lowest rate of success at 48%

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	The highest rate of success for Kickstarter plays is 76% for projects launched with a goal of less than $1000.  The greater the goal, the less likely the campaigns are to succeed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	This data set contains 4114 Kickstarter campaigns, 1066 of which are plays.  As of July of 2021, Kickstarter has launched over 500,000 projects.  If there was a broader data set, we would have greater variance, and therefore see a truer picture.  It is harder to diagnose how the content of can lead to its success or failure, without any data on the content.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	The best time to launch a play on Kickstarter would be May (69%) or June(70%).
	The worst time to launch a play on Kickstarter would be December, with a success rate of 48%.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	The plays with the highest success rate have a Goal of less than $1000 with a 76% chance of success.  The greater the goal, the less likely one is to meet it.
	If I were to launch a play on Kickstarter, I would start small, and then gradually ask for a greater budget as my reputation improves.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	It's a small dataset with a grand total of 1066 Kickstarter campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	A table could be made to determine whether being in the Kickstarter spotlight has a significant
